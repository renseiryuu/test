  "description": "Jin Clice is a super dashing spy, special agent for Japan's elite espionage program, whose body was mortally wounded by the KGB. Having already invested a lot of money in him, the agency would not allow him to die so easily though. Desperately trying to save his life, the government transferred his mind into the body of a recently deceased tennis player which happens to be a young beautiful woman! The dashing ladies man has, in essence, gone from being Bond to being the Bond girl!",
